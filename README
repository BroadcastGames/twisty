             Twisty, a z-machine interpreter for Android.
             ============================================

What is this program?
---------------------

Twisty is a z-machine interpreter for the Android operating system.
It allaws you to play "text adventures' on your mobile handset.

The z-machine is a virtual machine designed in 1979 by Infocom for
playing text adventures, and has been re-implemented on nearly every
computer and PDA since then.  This application allows Android users to
play Infocom classics just as 'Zork', as well hundreds of newer text
adventures written in the last ten years or so.

You can find numerous z-machine games to download at

History
-------

*** NOTE THAT THIS VERSION OF TWISTY IS UNDER "MAINTEANCE MODE" ONLY.
*** A REWRITE IS IN PROCESS TO USE NATIVE C CODE, ON A DIFFERENT
*** MERCURIAL BRANCH.


This code began as a heavily-hacked port of 'zplet', an early
lightweight z-machine interpreter written for Java 1.0.  It was then
connected to Android's various UI elements.

The original zplet source code is avaliable at

   http://www.speakeasy.org/~russotto/zplet/ifol.html


Installation & Usage
--------------------

Download the latest .apk file and use 'adb install' to copy it in your
Android emulator.  It has a few z-games built in, but can also load
any z3, z5, or z8 came from the /sdcard.


Building from Source
--------------------

To build, you'll need Eclipse 3.x, the public Android SDK, and the
Android plugin for Eclipse.

If you check out /trunk from subversion, you can create a new project
in Eclipse "from an existing source tree."  Be sure to convert the
project to an Android project.
