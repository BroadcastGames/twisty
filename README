             ============================================

What is this program?
---------------------

Twisty is a z-machine interpreter for the Android operating system.
It allaws you to play "text adventures' on your handset.

The z-machine is a virtual machine designed in 1979 by Infocom for
playing text adventures, and has been re-implemented on nearly every
computer and PDA since then.  This application allows Android users to
play Infocom classics just as 'Zork', as well hundreds of newer text
adventures written in the last ten years or so.

History
-------

This code began as a heavily-hacked port of 'zplet', an early
lightweight z-machine interpreter written for Java 1.0.  It was then
connected to Android's various UI elements.
