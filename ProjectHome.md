## Filing Bugs ##

The version of this game distributed on Market (0.8x) is a year old, and we have a complete rewrite coming up soon.  Please only file bugs against the new version (2.0), of which extremely-alpha versions are available in the 'Downloads' tab.  Bugs filed against the Market version of this app are fairly useless to us.

## What is this Android App? ##

This application allows Android users to play Infocom classics just as 'Zork', as well hundreds of newer text adventures written in the last ten years or so.  The package comes bundled with a few built-in games, but also allows you to load games from your sdcard.

Specifically, it implements a 'z-machine': a virtual machine designed in 1979 by Infocom for playing text adventures, which has been re-implemented on nearly every computer and PDA since then.  To learn more about the platform and all the games available, start by reading [the wikipedia entry on Interactive Fiction.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction)


## Can I Help Write the App? ##

To get involved with development, join the twisty-dev googlegroup and introduce yourself!  We're currently in the process of doing a massive rewrite of the game:  we're moving from a java-based interpreter (fairly slow) to a set of C-based interpreters running native ARM code (fairly fast, and compatible with a wider range of games.)

When cloning the mercurial repository, note that the **default** branch is the unstable 2.0 rewrite, and the **release** branch is the 0.X line currently up on Android Market.  Each branch has build instructions in the README file.


## How Do I Get It? ##

Download (the OLD version) directly to your Android device now by clicking the 'download' link to the right, or just get it from Android Market.


The new extremely buggy 2.0 rewrite (not yet finished!) is available from the 'Downloads' tab.
