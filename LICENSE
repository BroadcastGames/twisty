              Licenses on Bundled Games


* 'Adventure' is a re-creation of the very first text adventure game
  ever.  It was originally written by William Crowther and Donald
  Woods for a mainframe, but later recreated from scratch (by Graham
  Nelson) to run on the z-machine.

  The source and binary are freely distributed around the internet,
  with no license or distribution terms attached.  The Inform 6 source
  code can be fetched from

    http://www.ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/source/inform/Advent.inf


* 'Anchorhead' is a Lovecraftian-style horror game by Michael
  S. Gentry, and a finalist and winner in the 1998 Xyzzy Awards.
  According to the 'help' message within the game, the game is
  "absolutely freeware".


* 'Curses' is a game by Graham Nelson <graham@gnelson.demon.co.uk>,
   and is freely distributable by anyone, provided there's no profit involved.

   The official blurb from Graham is:

      "Curses" is not shareware, it's free: I wrote it for fun.  It
       may be freely distributed provided you aren't making a profit
       on the deal; I have allowed several magazines to put it on
       cover discs, so feel free to get in touch if you have that in
       mind.  But it _is_ copyright, and the source code is _not_
       public.  Moreover, the secret debugging commands may only be
       divulged to a druid of good standing.
